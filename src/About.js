        Did you have a particular show in mind, something you really want to
        watch but you’re not sure where you’ll find it? Because you certainly
        don’t see it on Netflix right now and Google is just not helping today!
        Well, we have got you covered. The idea for Flickhub was born just like
        this. We were not sure where to find this movie we wanted to watch. We
        have all been there. :( So, we thought, “What if we had a platform that
        will tell us what movie is streaming on which platform so we can watch
        what we want without the whole hassle of going on each platform on
        looking for that one particular movie?" This is exactly what we do. We
        connect you to non stop entertainment of your choice. We help you find
        the perfect tv show, an awesome movie or that documentary you wanted to
        watch in this big jungle of online streaming platforms. At Flickhub, we
        cover OTT (over the top) platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime video,
        Bigflix, Voot, ALT Balaji, Viu, Sony LIV, Eros now, ZEE5 and Hotstar. We
        not only help you find the trending, popular and high quality content
        streaming online, but also all the Bollywood and Hollywood movies, all
        the classics and the underrated shows that aren’t shown enough.
        Basically, we’re your new BFFs in the browsing department, because
        “Nobody searches it better!” So, browse away, my friend.
